# Simulation-of-Physical-Systems-Using-Multiscale-Methods-
Multiscale methods are key to simulating complex physical systems across spatial and temporal scales. They combine computational approaches to connect atomic (ab initio) and macroscopic (e.g., finite difference) behaviors, offering a comprehensive understanding of physical phenomena.
